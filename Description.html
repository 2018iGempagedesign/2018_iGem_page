<h1>
    Improving our 3-HP(3-hydroxypropionic acid) biosensor
</h1>
<h3>
    Project Description
</h3>

<p>

    &#09;Many industrial manufacturing processes revolve around the molecule 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP). This
    organic molecule can be used in a variety of industrial products, from biofuels to bioplastic production. As a
    biologically produced chemical, 3HP is biodegradable and thus a better substitute for inorganic plastics for
    environmental reasons. As 3HP-derived plastics degrade, they release carbon dioxide, but do not persist for
    thousands of years in landfills (as PET plastics do). While much of the field is focusing on maximizing the
    production of this important molecule, a much smaller subset is focused on finding ways to sense and measure
    its production in an effort to aid industrial manufacturing systems. In a recent study, genes from the
    bacteria <i> Pseudomonas putida </i> were incorporated into <i> Escherichia coli </i> and <i> Cupriavidus
    necator </i> and demonstrated that re-purposed regulatory proteins from <i> P. putida </i> could be used as a
    biosensor for 3HP (Hanko et al. 2017). A separate study identified similar 3HP responsive genes in <i>
    Pseudomonas denitrificans </i> (Zhou et al. 2015).

    &#09;Our summer iGEM research project seeks to use the same 3HP responsive genes found in <i> P. putida </i>
    and <i> P. denitrificans </i> as switches for a reporter. This reporter will ‘program’ our bacteria to express
    a unique color in response to the presence of 3HP. Additionally, we are seeking to add this system to <i>
    Bacillus subtilis </i>, a hardy bacterium that has great potential as a 3HP producer for industrial processes
    and metabolic engineering experiments. <i> B. subtilis </i> can withstand high concentrations of 3HP without
    triggering ‘toxicity’ pathways. By modifying naturally occurring proteins with 3HP sensitive genes in new
    organisms, we can tune our biosensor to be used for different purposes in research and industry. This
    collection of 3HP responsive biological tools can also be used by future iGEM teams around the world, as we
    will package our system in biological packets known as Biobricks. Similar to Lego pieces snapping together,
    Biobricks can be easily incorporated into bacteria by other iGEM teams to build larger projects with an
    amalgam of these biological building blocks.
